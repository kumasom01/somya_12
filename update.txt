c)MATMAS IDOC is used for sending material from ECC to DMC
d)SFC- SHOP FLOOR CONTROL- is an unique identifier used to track a material throughout production.
e)XSLT-Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT)-used for XML data transformations.
f)Unit of measure (UoM) specifies the standard measurement unit that is used to count items  Pieces, feet, pounds, 
and gallons are all examples of units of measure.
g)Lot size- how much quantity you need to produced against material.LOT Size will depend on SFC
h)Change Production - if u add any new operation it will not reflect in DMC if sfc was released against the order
so we are using change production.

 create a custom BAPI.
2)Today we have a call with SAP team for SFC status is not changing issue.

  BAPI(Business Application Programming Interface)

BAPI will pull data from ECC to DMC. for example if you need data from ECC to DMC. 
We can use BAPI it will pull data from ECC to DMC/MII


8-dec

1)We are Working on custom data collection validation scenarios into operator POD 
Manage data collection-- we can collect data for SFC. 
which data we can collect...(we assign    unique no. for production order in sfc.)

Hello Swanad Sir,
Today, I Build a custom DMC POD Plugin using Business Application Studio.


08- jan 2024

1)Truncated username is passing from DMC to ECC for change production orders during activity confirmation. 
So Vignesh is working with ABAP team.

a)Truncated- When a username is truncated, some characters from the end of the username are removed to fit within the specified length constraint.

For example, if a system has a maximum username length of 15 characters, and a user with the username "john_doe_long_username" tries to register,
 the system might truncate the username to "john_doe_long_u" if only 15 characters are allowed.

q)Change Production- if u add any new operation it will not reflect in DMC if sfc was released against the order
so we are using change production.


b)Ativity Confirmation-
Activity confirmation" involves recording the time spent on specific tasks.Once this time data is captured, it is then transmitted to the ECC 
, marking the completion and confirmation of the associated activities."

 When we send labour time to SFC  means  whatever activity you done that time is recorded that confirmation ,
 we send to ECC then it called Activity confirmation.

Activity confirmation like a time tracking activity

C)SAP ECC stands for SAP ERP Central Component. It is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software developed by SAP.
SAP ECC is a comprehensive suite of integrated business applications that enables organizations to manage and streamline various business processes.
